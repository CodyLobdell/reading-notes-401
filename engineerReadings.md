1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
  - I possess a unique set of skills, experiences, and perspectives that I am able to bring to a career in software development. Being able to directly implement my backgorund in Geospatial Imagery technology will give me a leg up on the possible competition.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
  - Take a break, Break the problem down, and Collaborate with others (as much as possible).
