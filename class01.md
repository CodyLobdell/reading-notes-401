Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
  - Node.js is like a powerful tool that developers can use to build all sorts of cool things on the internet, like chat apps, online stores, and social networks. It's like a magic wand that lets you do more with the programming language you already know.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
  - Node.js as a JavaScript runtime provides a powerful and flexible environment for running JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling developers to build a wide range of applications using a single programming language.

3. What is Node used for?
  - Building web applications: Node.js is often used as the backend for web applications, where it provides a fast and scalable server-side environment for running JavaScript code. Popular web frameworks like Express.js and Nest.js are built on top of Node.js, and many well-known companies, such as Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal, use Node.js for their web applications.

  - Real-time applications: Node.js's event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O make it well-suited for building real-time applications, such as chat apps, online games, and collaborative tools.

  - APIs: Node.js is often used to build APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which are used to connect different software components and services together. Node.js provides a fast and efficient way to handle HTTP requests and responses, making it a popular choice for building APIs.

  - Command-line tools: Node.js can be used to build command-line tools and scripts that automate repetitive tasks or perform complex data processing. Node.js's built-in modules and large package ecosystem make it easy to work with files, streams, and other system resources.

  - Desktop applications: With frameworks like Electron, Node.js can be used to build desktop applications that run on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Applications like Visual Studio Code, Slack, and Discord are built with Electron and Node.js.

Additional Questions

1. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
  - RBAC(Role-based access control). RBAC provides a way to control who can access what resources based on their roles and responsibilities within the organization, and I'm excited to get familiar with how to construct the framework for such a process.

2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
  - Being able to fully implement event-Driven Applications into my projects and task out actions to be user-specific.
