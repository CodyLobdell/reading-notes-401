What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
- Different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses in terms of their time complexity for different operations such as searching, inserting, deleting, and accessing elements. Therefore, it is important to choose a data structure that can efficiently perform the operations required by the problem at hand.


How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
- To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we need to ensure that our recursive function has a base case that will eventually terminate the recursion.
   The base case is a condition that, when met, will cause the function to stop calling itself and return a value.
