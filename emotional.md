<!-- Leaders can’t just be book smart, they have to be people smart. They have to know how to be vulnerable and empathetic, connect with the people around them, and build real relationships. 
It's not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life. I know many people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially inept and unsuccessful at work or in their personal relationships. 
Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ) isn't enough on its own to achieve success in life. My IQ can help when becoming a software developer, but it's my EQ that will help myself manage the stress and emotions when facing final exams/projects. IQ and EQ exist in tandem and are most effective when they build off one another.
The skills that make up emotional intelligence can be learned at any time. However, it's important to remember that there is a difference between simply learning about EQ and applying that knowledge to life. Just because I know I should do something doesn't mean I will, especially when I become overwhelmed by stress, which can override my best intentions. In order to permanently change behavior in ways that stand up under pressure, it's imperative to learn how to overcome stress in the moment, and in any relationships, in order to remain emotionally aware. -->
