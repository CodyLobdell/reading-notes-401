The terminal seemed daunting at first (back in 101!). However, Over time I've learned that Linux is full of shortcuts to help make life easier. 
Learning that the command cd may be run without a location but usually will be run with a single command line argument which is the location we would like to change into was interesting. 

The location is specified as a path and as such may be specified as either an absolute or relative path and using any of the path building blocks.

Everything is actually a file! A text file is a file, a directory is a file, my keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), my monitor is even a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. 

The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on my system including what they do, the specifics of how I run them and what command line arguments they accept. Some of them were a little hard to get my head around at first. But they are fairly consistent in their structure so once I had gotten the hang of it, it's wasn't too bad. 

It's critical that I create a directory structure that helps organise that data in a manageable way. EVERY. TIME.
